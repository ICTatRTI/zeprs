<h2>ZEPRS groups</h2>

<p>The groups currently in-use are Superusers(group id 1), Clinic
Medical Staff (group id 5), Clinic/UTH Admins (group id 19), LUDHMB Staff
ID/Login Admistrator (group id 9), , and Clerks (group id 18). Most users
should be assigned to the Clinic Medical Staff group.</p>

<h2>Description of ZEPRS groups:</h2>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li>Superusers – full priv, including use of the Dynasite admin app. This group may not be assigned by the User Administration app.</li>
 <li>Clinic Medical Staff – able to create/modify patient
     records, but not view reports</li>
 <li>Clinic/UTH Admins - able to create/modify patient records
     and view reports</li>
 <li>LUDHMB Staff ID/Login Admistrator – access only to the
     User Administration app.</li>
 <li>Clerks – able to search for patient, view and modify
     patient demographics.</li>
 <li>View Patient Records only (group id 16) is only used to
     demonstrate a highly restricted group.</li>
</ul>

<p>UTH and CIDRZ Medical staff are not active groups. Since
most clinicians rotate from clinics to UTH, it may make sense simply to assign
everyone to Clinic Medical Staff. If someone needs to view reports as well as
create/modify patient records, assign them to Clinic/UTH Admins.</p>
