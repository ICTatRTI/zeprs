copy archive.xml to tomcat\conf\Catalina\localhost

Note the following tomcat dirs - endorsed, lib, and classes

Copy libs\mysql-connector-java-5.x-bin.jar  *tomcat*\lib
Copy libs\log4j-1.2.13.jar  *tomcat*\lib
Copy libs\commons-logging.jar  *tomcat*\lib
Copy libs\commons-el.jar  *tomcat*\lib
Copy libs\log4j.properties  *tomcat*\lib

I'm unable to script the installation of the databases because I don't know the root password on the system you are installing. 
I'll automate this in the future.

To install the databases, enter the command line and cd to this install dir.

Create the admin, zeprs, zeprsdemo databases by running the following command:
mysql -u root -p mysql < create-dbs.sql
It will prompt you for the root password.

admin_install.sql - use this to populate the admin database. On the command line enter the following:
mysql -u root -p admin < admin_install.sql

zeprs_install.sql - use this to populate the zeprs database and the zeprsdemo database. 
The zeprsdemo database is used for testing and training personnel on a "live" system - data they enter won�t appear in reports. 

On the command line enter the following:
mysql -u root -p zeprs < zeprs_install.sql

mysql -u root -p zeprsdemo < zeprs_install.sql

The next two databases are easier to create - the scripts create the databases:
mysql -u root -p mysql < mail_install.sql
mysql -u root -p mysql < userdata_install.sql

Those two databases - mail and userdata - are used for user credentials. 

Finally, create privs in mysql for the new databases so that the web application has access to them:

mysql -u root -p mysql< db_permissions.sql

Assuming you made it this far, start tomcat. Watch the log in logs/catalina.out. If all looks ok, try to login.

To login to the ZEPRS app as administrator - with full privs - use the zepadmin/zepadmin11 username/password.

Any issues will likely be relating to permissions. I�ll certainly help you clear these up. 

To run ant tasks, copy installation/local.properties to the root zeprs source dir - in the same dir as build.xml. 
Customize the paths to suite your install. The main things to customize are:

baseDir=C:\\source\\zeprs
toolsDir=C:\\tools
warArchiveDir=C:\\zeprs-wars
