Thank you for your interest in ZEPRS. ZEPRS is free and open source. I'm
in the process of putting together an installer for ZEPRS. In a nutshell,
here are the technical requirements:

* Java 1.5
* MySQL 5
* Apache tomcat 5.5


There are three main components to the app:

* ZEPRS war - the tomcat web app archive.
* MySQL databases:
        * zeprs - patient data
        * admin - administrative database - for forms/fields and
other metadata
        * zeprsdemo - for testing of zeprs
* tomcat libs - zeprs-related libs - go in tomcat/common/libs
directory

Currently the system assumes that there is a mysql database on the same
machine as the app. This is certainly configurable however. I'll provide
more detailed instructions once I sort out the distro.

Here are the files in the archive with install instructions:
(Note - when I refer to *tomcat*, that is the tomcat installation dir, such as C:\program files\apache software foundation\Tomcat 5.5\)

zeprs.war - place in your tomcat distro’s webapps dir.

Unzip the file archive.zip in the webapps dir.
copy archive.xml to tomcat\conf\Catalina\localhost

Note the following tomcat dirs - endorsed, lib, and classes

Copy libs\mysql-connector-java-3.1.10-bin.jar  *tomcat*\common\endorsed

Copy libs\log4j-1.2.13.jar  *tomcat*\common\lib
Copy libs\commons-logging.jar  *tomcat*\common\lib
Copy libs\commons-el.jar  *tomcat*common\lib

Copy libs\log4j.properties  *tomcat*\common\classes

I'm unable to script the installation of the databases because I don't know the root password on the system you are installing. 
I'll automate this in the future.

To install the databases, enter the command line and cd to this install dir.

Create the admin, zeprs, zeprsdemo databases by running the following command:
mysql -u root -p mysql < create-dbs.sql
It will prompt you for the root password.

admin_install.sql - use this to populate the admin database. On the command line enter the following:
mysql -u root -p admin < admin_install.sql

zeprs_install.sql - use this to populate the zeprs database and the zeprsdemo database. 
The zeprsdemo database is used for testing and training personnel on a "live" system - data they enter won’t appear in reports. 

On the command line enter the following:
mysql -u root -p zeprs < zeprs_install.sql

mysql -u root -p zeprsdemo < zeprs_install.sql

The next two databases are easier to create - the scripts create the databases:
mysql -u root -p mysql < mail_install.sql
mysql -u root -p mysql < userdata_install.sql

Those two databases - mail and userdata - are used for user credentials. 

Finally, create privs in mysql for the new databases so that the web application has access to them:

mysql -u root -p mysql< db_permissions.sql

Assuming you made it this far, start tomcat. Watch the log in logs/catalina.out. If all looks ok, try to login.

To login as administrator - with full privs, use the zepadmin/zepadmin11 username/password.

I have not tested this yet, so chances are, it may not work. Any issues will likely be relating to permissions. 
I’ll certainly help you clear these up.
